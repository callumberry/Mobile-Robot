# Workshop 8.1 Battery Monitoring and Mode Switching

## Design Round 4 Scrum Planning

### What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this roundâ€™s design review deliverables, what are your own goals?
Our primary goal is completing the CAD for the gripper/arm mechanism and connect the motors to the gamepad so the robot can move around. We will need to determine the material type that will be used for the arm/gripper and determime our button mapping for the controller (i.e determine which button corresponds with which output). Another goal is fine tuning our PID control for the DC motor with the wheels now attached. Lastly, we need to start working with the line following sensor to facilitate the autonomous mode. 

### What are the backlog items from last round?
As of right now, we need to finish setting up the controller with the DC motors, finsh up CAD modelling grabbing mechanism the design and create a more accurate 2D diagram of the board.

### What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?
1. Integrate DC motors with controller - Mustafa
2. Create accurate 2D model of the compeition board - Callum
3. Fine Tune PID loop for DC motor - Mustafa
4. Complete Chassis 3D model and begin arm/gripper - Callum
5. Material choice for arm/gripper - Callum 
6. Finalize button mapping - Callum and Mustafa
7. Start integrating the line follower with the motors - Mustafa

## Workshop 7.2 Work Plan Reflection 
Overall, we are following the schedule for this project quite well. To ensure we meet the design review goals on time, we schedule our time to ensure all required components are finished and divide up the milestones between ourselves to ensure neither of us is carrying too much of the work. This requires a lot communication and timing between partners, and we have ensured we both understand what is expected of each other. We have budgeted our materials correctly, ensuring that we have some excess material we don't plan on using in case we face a scenario where we need something created urgently. Lastly, we consult each other when required, ensuring both team members are "on the same page" and understand the design going forward. This ensures both of us have the same vision for the design as we test and design our individual components. 

## Workshop 7.2 Module Integration Reflection 
The wheel integration with the motor went very well. The module performed as expected with the tank treads and we did not encounter problems we were concerned with, such as improper fittings or not meshing with the tank treads properly. For the next iteration, adding more perimeters to the mount between the motor and the wheel would increase the strength of the wheel, ensuring the opposite force from the bolts would not damage the wheels in the long term. 

## Design for Sustainability
During this project, we kept in mind many environmental considerations to ensure our robot was designed for sustainability. To limit waste, we used additive manufacturing to create our tank treads, wheels, gripper. 3D printing also allowed us to design these parts very precisely, ensuring their functionality wasn't comprimised either. Another way we reduced the energy consumption of the robot was by using rechargable batteries, which are more energy-efficient than regular batteries. Lastly, to avoid robot abandonment, we made our robot components modular and easily removable, ensuring no components will be wasted during dissassembly.
