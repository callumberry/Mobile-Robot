# Workshop 8.1 Battery Monitoring and Mode Switching

## Design Round 4 Scrum Planning

### What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this roundâ€™s design review deliverables, what are your own goals?
Our primary goal is completing the CAD for the gripper/arm mechanism and connect the motors to the gamepad so the robot can move around. We will need to determine the material type that will be used for the arm/gripper and determime our button mapping for the controller (i.e determine which button corresponds with which output). Another goal is fine tuning our PID control for the DC motor with the wheels now attached. 

### What are the backlog items from last round?
As of right now, we need to finish setting up the controller with the DC motors, finsh up CAD modelling grabbing mechanism the design and create a more accurate 2D diagram of the board.

### What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?
1. Integrate DC motors with controller - Mustafa
2. Create accurate 2D model of the compeition board - Callum
3. Fine Tune PID loop for DC motor - Mustafa
4. Complete Chassis 3D model and begin arm/gripper - Callum
5. Material choice for arm/gripper - Callum and Mustafa
6. Finalize button mapping - Callum and Mustafa
