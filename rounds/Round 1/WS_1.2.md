## Summary of Design Problem
1. Getting through the gate
2. Retreive and place doll on helipad
3. Corral dinosaurs to caged area

## Sub-objectives
1. Movement of robot (number of motors used, turning mechanisms, tank treads vs wheels)
2. Design (determine size and scale of the design and placement of the components e.x how should the arm mechanism be placed and designed such that it can reach the doll in the pit)
3. Determine mechanism to grab and pickup dinosaurs/doll (3 jointed arm vs linearly extended arm vs excavator bucket)

## Constraints
1. Limited sensors
2. Non-continuous servo motors
3. Print Volume
4. Time allowed to complete competition
5. Processing Power

# Brainstorm

## Ideas
1. Tank treads/Skid Steer
2. Sweeping Arm to push dinosaurs off of ledges
3. Line following instead of using button
4. Arm that gets extended outwards linearly with servomotor (like a fireman's ladder)
5. Wheels
6. Bulldozer
7. Bucket
8. Pincher Claw
9. 3-jointed arm, allowing for flexability 
10. Flexible Gripper (TPU)

## Top 3
1. Pulleyed Wrist and flexible claws (made from TPU) that extend outwards
2. Tank Tread
3. Rotation in arm to guide arm towards dinosaurs placed on rocks

## Paragraph
The three elements we have chosen as a part of our design are tank treads, a pulleyed wrist which connects to the claws, and a rotating shoulder of the arm. 3D printed tank treads will provide a great amount of traction to the surface of the board. Tank treads can also help ensure all wheels are in sync together, as the front wheels will be physically connected to the back wheels. This will help minimize slip between the wheels, which is a potential issue as two of them won't have motors attached to them. The robot's arm mechanism will rely on a a pulleyed wrist and flexible claws made from TPU filament. To move the gripper, we will create a wrist hinge with a pulley connected to a servomotor. By using a pulleye, we can place the servomotor farther down the arm, ensuring the entire mechanism does not fall over. The claws will be made from TPU filament, allowing them to easily mold to the shape of the objects they grab, ensuring better grip. Since te slaws will be able to extend outwards due to the mechanism, a linearly extended arm won't be needed. Lastly,servomotor controlled shoulder will maneuver the arm to ensure the claws can grab the dinosaurs placed on rocks.
