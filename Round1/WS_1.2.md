## Summary of Design Problem
1. Getting through the gate
2. Rescue doll
3. Corral dinosaurs

## Sub-objectives
1. Movement of robot
2. Control (autonomous, manual)
3. Optimization

## Constraints
1. Limited sensors
2. Non-continuous servo motors
3. Print Volume
4. Time allowed to complete competition
5. Processing Power

# Brainstorm

## Ideas
1. Tank treads/Skid Steer
2. Sweeping Arm to push dinosaurs off of ledges
3. Line following instead of using button
4. Arm that gets extended outwards linearly with servomotor (like a fireman's ladder)
5. Wheels
6. Bulldozer
7. Bucket
8. Pincher Claw
9. 3-jointed arm, allowing for flexability 
10. Flexible Gripper (TPU)

## Top 3
1. Linear Arm Extension with Pulleyed Wrist and flexible grippers
2. Tank Tread
3. Rotation in arm to push dinosaurs off the rocks

## Paragraph
1. Tank Treads (coolness factor), wheels if to slow
2. Flexible Gripper (TPU)
3. Sweeping Arm knocking off dinosaurs
