# Design Round 1 Scrum Planning
## Specific Goals
1. Create a detailed and scaled drawing of our inital design. This will provide us with  a better understanding of how to 3D model it. 
2. Start coding with the servo and DC motors. Become familar with them and integrate them with the controller (e.x make dc motor move counter clockwise by moving joystick)
3. Begin planning, 3D modelling and printing a preliminary design we can use to start integrating parts and test our inital design idea

## Tasks
1. Detailed & scaled drawing:
    a. take accurate measurements of the competition board
    b. sketch inital designs, keeping in mind where all the parts would go 
    c. plan out the dimensions for each part of the design

2. Testing & integrating motors:
    a. code and test the servomotor individually. Write code to test the motor under different circumstances e.x clockwise, counterclockwise, varying speeds 
    b. code and test the DC motor individually. Write code to test the motor under different circumstances e.x clockwise, counterclockwise, varying speeds
    c. integrate with the controller i.e map out button and joystick inputs to different movements with the motors. 
    d. once it has been determined which controller inputs will coincide with motor outputs, create functions that handle each input e.x left joystick function, right joystick function, etc

3. 3D Model & printing preliminary design 
    a. based on the detailed drawing, create a 3D CAD model
    b. research which filaments to use on each part of the design e.x tank treads could be TPU while the chasis could be PLA 
    c. start printing the model and integrate the design once the model has been 3D printed
