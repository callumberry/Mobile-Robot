### What are the backlog items from last round?
As of right now, we need to start integrating the controller with the DC motors, finsh up CAD modelling the design and create a more accurate 2D diagram of the board.

### What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?
1. Integrate DC motors with controller - Mustafa
2. Create accurate 2D model of the compeition board - Callum
3. Fine Tune PID loop for DC motor - Mustafa
4. Complete Chassis 3D model and begin arm - Callum
