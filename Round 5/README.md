# Workshop 10.1 and 10.2: Autonomous Mode Implimentation & Prototype Testing

## Design Round 5 Scrum Planning

### What are the specific goals for this round? Aside from meeting this roundâ€™s design review deliverables, what are your own goals?
Our primary goal is testing the completed CAD for the gripper/arm mechanism and start to impliment the autonomous mode for the robot. We will need to start testing the line following sensor to determine its range of operating values and sensitivity. Another goal is to integrate the arm mechanism with controller to determine our button mapping with the servomotors. We will also need to test the arm mechanism extensively to determine if it is capable to manipulate Ken and the dinosaurs. 

### What are the backlog items from last round?
As of right now, we need to 3D print the arm mechanism and start integrating the line following sensor into our design. 

### What are the tasks needed to achieve each goal, including the backlog items?
1. Write code to start testing line following sensor - Mustafa
2. Finish designing and 3D print arm mechanism - Callum
3. Finalize button mapping and controller integration for servos - Callum 

## Workshop 7.2 Work Plan Reflection 
Overall, we are following the schedule for this project quite well. To ensure we meet the design review goals on time, we schedule our time to ensure all required components are finished and divide up the milestones between ourselves to ensure neither of us is carrying too much of the work. This requires a lot communication and timing between partners, and we have ensured we both understand what is expected of each other. We have budgeted our materials correctly, ensuring that we have some excess material we don't plan on using in case we face a scenario where we need something created urgently. Lastly, we consult each other when required, ensuring both team members are "on the same page" and understand the design going forward. This ensures both of us have the same vision for the design as we test and design our individual components. 

## Workshop 7.2 Module Integration Reflection 
The wheel integration with the motor went very well. The module performed as expected with the tank treads and we did not encounter problems we were concerned with, such as improper fittings or not meshing with the tank treads properly. For the next iteration, adding more perimeters to the mount between the motor and the wheel would increase the strength of the wheel, ensuring the opposite force from the bolts would not damage the wheels in the long term. 

## Design for Sustainability
During this project, we kept in mind many environmental considerations to ensure our robot was designed for sustainability. To limit waste, we used additive manufacturing to create our tank treads, wheels, gripper. 3D printing also allowed us to design these parts very precisely, ensuring their functionality wasn't comprimised either. Another way we reduced the energy consumption of the robot was by using rechargable batteries, which are more energy-efficient than regular batteries. Lastly, to avoid robot abandonment, we made our robot components modular and easily removable, ensuring no components will be wasted during dissassembly.
